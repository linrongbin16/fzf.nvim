### 1. Cannot go upper in empty directory?

When in normal variant (not showing hidden files/directories), once cd into an empty directory (with `CTRL-L`) you will cannot go upper (with `CTRL-H`).

Please switch to hidden variant (with `CTRL-U`), e.g. showing hidden files/directories, thus there will have two lines `.` and `..`, then you could go upper (with `CTRL-H`).
