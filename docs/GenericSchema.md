## Introduction

A fzf-based search command usually consists of below components:

- **Provider**: A shell command that generates the lines for (the left side of) the fzf binary.

  - (Optional) **Provider Decorator**: A lua function that modifies the generated lines. For example `FzfxFiles` prepends file type icons for each line generated by provider `fd`/`find` command.

- **Previewer**: A shell command that generates the contents to preview the current line under cursor/marker in the fzf's (right side of) preview window.

  - (Optional) **Previewer Label**: A label (string) on the top of fzf's preview window, which gives extra hint and summary.

- **Action**: A key that first quits fzf's interactive window, then invokes a registered lua function with selected lines. For example, press `ENTER` key in `FzfxFiles` will quit popup window and open all the selected files.
- (Optional) **Interaction**: A key that invokes a registered lua function but doesn't quit the fzf binary. For example, press `CTRL-U`/`CTRL-R` key in `FzfxFiles` will switch between **unrestricted mode** and **restricted mode**.
- (Optional) **Fzf Option**: Other fzf options that control the fzf binary's layout/border/etc.
- (Optional) **Other Option**: Other special options that control some specific searching behavior, for example live reloading, popup window layout, etc.

This is a [producer-consumer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem), i.e. **Provider** is the data producer, **Previewer** and **Action**/**Interaction** are the data consumers. We also say it's a dataflow, when putting all these components together, it's named a **Pipeline** in this plugin.

With this pattern, all the details of launching the fzf shell command and interacting across different child processes within nvim editor are hidden, only a friendly config layer is provided to user and allows third-party plugin developers to create almost any searching commands on their own needs.

Let's define it more specifically.

> Also see [`schema.lua`](https://github.com/linrongbin16/fzfx.nvim/blob/main/lua/fzfx/schema.lua).

## Context

A **context** is some data that passing to pipeline.

Starting a searching command is actually creating a popup window and a terminal, running a fzf shell command inside it. Thus there's no way to get the current buffer number (`bufnr`) or current window number (`winnr`) you're editing (actually it's the _previous_ buffer/window).

So we need a way to store the **_current_** buffer/window info in somewhere, so we need to create a context before creating the popup window and launching the shell command.

## Provider

A **provider** is a component that can generate data sources (the lines) for (the left side of) the fzf command.

When this plugin starts, it prepares data sources for the fzf command, and then launch a child process to feed these data sources to the fzf command. Since the `nvim` can be used as a lua interpreter, a headless Neovim editor, we could leverage it as a Neovim-editor-as-a-VM runtime and archives a lot of functions, including running a shell command, send GRPC call to the Neovim editor (users are using), etc.

> Also see: [fzfx's architecture](https://linrongbin16.github.io/fzfx.nvim/#/How).

We have several types of providers:

- Plain command provider: Plain lua data types (i.e. lua string or array) that represents a shell command, which can be executed inside the child process. For example:
  - `"fd . -cnever -tf -tl -L"`: A lua string that represents a shell command (find all file names in current working directory). This plugin will evaluate it with a `bash` shell, and generate data sources for the fzf command.
  - `{"fd", ".", "-cnever", "-tf", "-tl", "-L"}`: A lua array that contains multiple strings, it also represents the same shell command with above example. This plugin will launch it by operating system (directly without a `bash` shell), and generate data sources for the fzf command.
- Functional command provider: Hook lua function (with better flexibility), this plugin will first invoke it and get the result as a shell command (lua string or array), then execute inside the child process to get the final data sources for the fzf command. The hook function will be invoke on every keystroke to arhieve the real-time live query and reloading.
- Direct provider: Not all data sources are generated by the shell command, for example LSP symbols and diagnostics. Direct provider is also a hook lua function, this plugin will invoke it and get the result as the data sources for the fzf command.

### Provider Decorator

Sometimes we want to decorate the lines generated by providers, for example we want to prepend a file type icon at the beginning of each file names in `FzfxFiles` command. Here comes the **provider decorator**, it's a lua function that runs with a line as parameter, and returns a decorated line.

We have several types of provider decorators:

- File name decorator, it works for providers that generate file names as data sources. For example `FzfxFiles`, `FzfxBuffers`, etc.
- Grep decorator, it works for providers that generate grep results in format `{FileName}:{Line}:{Column}:{Text}` as data sources. For example `FzfxLiveGrep`, `FzfxGLiveGrep`, etc.

**Please always keep in mind**:

1. Decorators run inside the child process, which is outside of the Neovim editor.
2. No plugins are loaded, only standard LuaJIT and Neovim APIs are available.

## Previewer

A **previewer** is a shell command that uses current line as input, and generates contents for the fzf binary preview window (in the right side).

Similar to provider, previewer also runs the `nvim --headless -l` shell command to generate preview contents.

We have below types of previewers:

- Command previewer: A lua function that runs and returns a shell command (as a string or a string list), then executes and generates the contents for fzf's preview window.
- List previewer: A lua function that runs and directly returns the preview contents (in lines) for fzf.
- Buffer file previewer: A nvim buffer to show the file contents, which enables support for nvim current colorscheme.

```lua
--- @alias fzfx.CommandPreviewer fun(line:string?,context:fzfx.PipelineContext?):string?
--- @alias fzfx.ListPreviewer fun(line:string?,context:fzfx.PipelineContext?):string[]?
--- @alias fzfx.BufferFilePreviewerResult {filename:string,lineno:integer?,column:integer?}
--- @alias fzfx.BufferFilePreviewer fun(line:string?,context:fzfx.PipelineContext?):fzfx.BufferFilePreviewerResult?
--- @alias fzfx.Previewer fzfx.CommandPreviewer|fzfx.ListPreviewer|fzfx.BufferFilePreviewer
---
--- @alias fzfx.PreviewerType "command"|"command_list"|"list"|"buffer_file"
--
-- Note: the 1st parameter 'line' is the current line in (the left side of) the fzf binary.
```

### Previewer Label

Sometimes we want to add summary/hint for the preview window, for example we want to add a file name when previewing the file content. Here comes the **previewer label**, it's a lua function that runs with the current line as parameter, and returns the label string.

We have 2 types of previewers:

- Plain label: a static string value which is the label for the preview window.
- Function label: a lua function to run and returns the string value for the preview window.

```lua
--- @alias fzfx.PlainPreviewerLabel string
--- @alias fzfx.FunctionPreviewerLabel fun(line:string?,context:fzfx.PipelineContext?):string?
--- @alias fzfx.PreviewerLabel fzfx.PlainPreviewerLabel|fzfx.FunctionPreviewerLabel
---
--- @alias fzfx.PreviewerLabelType "plain"|"function"
--- @enum PreviewerLabelTypeEnum
local PreviewerLabelTypeEnum = {
  PLAIN = "plain",
  FUNCTION = "function",
}
--
-- Note: the 1st parameter 'line' is the current selected line.
```

## Command Feed

A **command feed** defines how to feed the query content to the search commands, i.e. the multiple variants (arguments, visual selected, yanked text, last searching contents) of a searching command.

```lua
--- @alias fzfx.CommandFeed "args"|"visual"|"cword"|"put"|"resume"
```

## Fzf Option

A **fzf option** is a simple string or a pair of two strings, that directly passes to the fzf binary. For example `--multi`, `--bind=ctrl-e:toggle`, `--layout=reverse`.

We have 3 types of fzf options:

- Plain option: A plain option as a simple string. For example `--multi`.
- Pair option: A plain option as a pair of two strings. For example `{ '--bind', 'ctrl-e:toggle' }`.
- Function option: A lua function that runs and returns above two types of fzf options.

```lua
--- @alias fzfx.PlainFzfOpt string
--- @alias fzfx.PairFzfOpt string[]
--- @alias fzfx.FunctionFzfOpt fun():fzfx.PlainFzfOpt|fzfx.PairFzfOpt
---
--- @alias fzfx.FzfOpt fzfx.PlainFzfOpt|fzfx.PairFzfOpt|fzfx.FunctionFzfOpt
```

## Interaction/Action

An **(inter)action** is a lua function that binds with a key, thus when user press it and been invoked.

We have 2 types of (inter)actions:

- Interaction: When user presses, it invokes the binded lua function with current line as parameter, without quitting popup window.
- Action: When user presses, it quits the popup window, then invokes the binded lua function with selected lines.

```lua
--- @alias fzfx.ActionKey string
--- @alias fzfx.Interaction fun(line:string?,context:fzfx.PipelineContext):any
--- @alias fzfx.Action fun(line:string[]|nil,context:fzfx.PipelineContext):any
--
-- Note: the 1st parameter in `Interaction` is the current line.
-- Note: the 1st parameter in `Action` is the selected line(s).
```

## Pipeline

A **pipeline** puts a provider, a previewer, some interactions and actions together, bring us the dataflow.

## Command Group

When facing the real-world searching command we're using, say `FzfxLiveGrep`, it actually contains:

- Multiple variants: Basic variant (`args`) that feeds with user arguments, visual select variant (`visual`) that feeds with visual selections, cursor word variant (`cword`) that feeds with cursor word, etc.
- Multiple data sources: Each data source has a unique provider/previewer and interaction (to let user switch to it). Note: If a searching command only contains 1 provider and previewer, it's not necessary to contain the interaction (because user has nothing to switch to).
- Multiple previewers: Each binds to a provider.
- Multiple actions: Allow user to do anything with selected lines when quitting popup window.
- (Optionally) Multiple interactions: Allow user to do anything without quitting popup window.
- (Optionally) Extra fzf options and other options: Some other configurations.
