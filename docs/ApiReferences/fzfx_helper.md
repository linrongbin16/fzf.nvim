# [`fzfx.helper`](https://github.com/linrongbin16/fzfx.nvim/tree/main/lua/fzfx/helper)

The `fzfx.helper` package contains all the line-oriented utilities for parsing and rendering the lines for (both left side and right side of) the fzf binary. Since a searching command is actually all about the lines: generating, previewing and invoking binded function on the lines.

And there're multiple sub-packages inside (sorted in alphabetical order):

- [`actions`](#fzfxhelperactions)
- [`parsers`](#fzfxhelperparsers)
